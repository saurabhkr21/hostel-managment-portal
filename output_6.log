(node:1576) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///C:/Users/saura/OneDrive/Desktop/hostel-managment-portal/scripts/test-db.ts is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to C:\Users\saura\OneDrive\Desktop\hostel-managment-portal\package.json.
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
